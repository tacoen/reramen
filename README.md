Renpy According Me, a modular approach.

It is renpy framework to help you creating of visual novell game.

## Features

* Extendable NPC
* Extendable Scene Map
* Feather light GUI (Themeable)
* Plugins (multipurpose) and 
* apps container (smartphone, pc)
* Multi-persistent main character stat
* Items and Inventory
* Shop and pawn
* Events with condition
* Episodes (DLC or standalone)

Todo: Things from the old-version of ramen :
